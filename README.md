# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## The Prework Study Guide was created to help bootcamp students navigate the modules for their prework assignments and so the individual can use this as a reference guide. In this study guide the next student will be able to learn what makes a webpage from the first set of codes to the deployment! The students will learn about the many languages, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more, also what job does the language have. The student will learn how to build a project by laying the fonduation of their work, customizing it/styling, making it interactive and watching their work come to life!

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## N/A

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Topics you will learn about in this study guide will be feature branches, learning how to merge changes into your main branch, Navigating Github and resolving issues!

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.



## N/A

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
